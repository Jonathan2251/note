1. Can open source clang/llvm without Andes' patch work with ACE?
2. Add __builtin function support in ACE:
For instance:
Add GCCBuiltin<"__builtin_tensor_add">, as follows,
$ vi $HOME/andes/riscv/Phoenix/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/IR/IntrinsicsACE.td 
def int_tensor_add : GCCBuiltin<"__builtin_riscv_tensor_add">, 
Intrinsic<[], [llvm_ptr_ty, llvm_ptr_ty, llvm_ptr_ty],
