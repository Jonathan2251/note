search: linux rename files in subfolders
$ find . -iname "*dbg*" -exec rename _dbg.txt .txt '{}' \; 
what the '{}' and \; are?

The -exec argument makes find execute rename for every matching file found. '{}' will be replaced with the path name of the file. The last token, \; is there only to mark the end of the exec expression.

1. rename *.cpp and *.hpp to *.cc and *.h
find src/ -name "*.cpp" -exec rename -v 's/\.cpp$/\.cc/i' {} \;              // {
find include/ -name "*.hpp" -exec rename -v 's/\.hpp$/\.h/i' {} \;

// display directory size
du -h ~/llvm
